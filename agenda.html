      <div class="abstract">
        <h4 class="text-success font-weight-bold">Practical transfer learning for NLP with spacy and Prodigy</h4>
        <p>Transfer learning has been called "NLP's ImageNet moment". Recent work has shown that models can be
          initialized
          with detailed,
          contextualised linguistic knowledge, drawn from huge samples of data. In this talk, I'll explain spaCy's new
          support for efficient and easy transfer learning.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="abstract">
        <h4 class="text-success font-weight-bold">Deep understanding text-based models</h4>
        <p>A data scientist should not only code machine learning models, but also understand their internal mechanisms.
          How do we deal with problems with text modeling in business applications and research and development
          projects?
          I will show several use cases that will include detection of emotions, language abuse and others. I will also
          show a tool to explain suspicious results in data sets and model results.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="abstract">
        <h4 class="text-success font-weight-bold">Simple is not easy - the overview of two projects</h4>
        <p>Even though the world of data science is fascinated by LSTMs and GANs, there are many commercial projects
          that
          do not have to use such heavy artillery to provide value for the client. In my talk,
          I will present two projects which main purpose was to create a tool for data analysis and visualization. First
          is an application for constant audit and the second is Twitter explorer. Both are data-based web apps and and
          gave our costumers major savings,
          with IQR (Interquartile Range) being the most advanced statistical concept used. While building those projects
          we encountered architectural and technical challenges. I will present some of them with our road to solution.
          Our tech stack was: Python-Flask, MariaDB, Elasticsearch, Vue, Boostrap.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="abstract">
        <h4 class="text-success font-weight-bold">Data analysis in neuroimaging</h4>
        <p>Neuroimaging is a rapidly advancing field which requires solving more and more complex challenges
          related to data analysis. Magnetic resonance scans of the brain are an invaluable source of information
          for clinicians and researchers but their correct analysis requires advanced statistical knowledge.
          In more recent years, neuroscientists have gotten access to much larger and complex datasets
          for which traditional ways of analysis are no longer adequate. I would like to show
          what kind of information we can get from neuroimages, what are the current challenges in the field
          and community proposed solutions.
        </p>

      <div class="abstract">
        <h4 class="text-success font-weight-bold">How to learn trusthworthy knowledge graphs?
          Seven problems and seven remedies</h4>
        <p>Knowledge graphs are now routinely used for search, question answering, conversation,
          intelligent dashboards etc.
          In my talk, firstly, I will define what knowledge graphs are, giving examples of notable
          both community-driven and industrial knowledge graphs.
          Then I will explore topics of knowledge extraction for building knowledge graphs and
          their further development prone to various problems such as incompleteness, bias,
          inconsistency, ambiguity and others and I will discuss how to overcome those problems.
        </p>

      <div class="abstract">
        <h4 class="text-success font-weight-bold">Robustness in machine vision: poking your
          deep learning model</h4>
        <p>For several years now, industrial Computer Vision systems have been powered by Deep Learning
          - also in production. If we should poke our code until it breaks, why would deep learning models
          gets a free pass? We'll see different ways in which to poke, improve and -above all-
          robustify a vision model before letting it run in production.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="abstract">
        <h4 class="text-success font-weight-bold">Cognimates: a platform for AI coding and education</h4>
        <p>Current artificial intelligence (AI) research efforts are driven by a society where adults see
          the opportunities of this new technology through the lens of old paradigms of progress.
          What if people could harness AI applications in novel ways that go beyond problem-solving
          and specific challenges. We can best begin to explore the potential of AI by inviting children
          to explore the infinite array of opportunities intelligent technology provides.
        </p>
        <p> Young people growing up with intelligent devices have an intrinsically different understanding
          of how this technology is embedded in our daily lives and are more open to imagine non-prescribed
          ways to interact and learn from and with it. Children experience the world through play and
          make-believe. This sets them at an advantage to explore all possibilities of reading and
          making the world. In this talk I will show you examples of how children are learning with
          and from AI and explain why this is a crucial time to involve the next generation in the
          process of designing a humanistic intelligent applications.</p>
