				<strong>Maria Knorps</strong>
				<p>IPhD in Fluid Mechanics. For the last 10 years I have been working on mathematical modelling of
					particles in
					turbulent flows and numerical simulations on HPC. My professional goal is application of
					mathematical concepts
					such as stochastic calculus to real-life problems. I believe that visualization is a key to present
					highly
					abstract concepts and, in opposition to Fortran and Python which I have been writing in the longest,
					I have a
					growing interest in functional programming. Currently I use my experience in the world of Data
					Science in IF
					Research Poland. Privately I am mum of two extraordinary boys.</p>
