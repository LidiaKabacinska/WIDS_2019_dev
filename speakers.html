				<span class="name">Anna Wróblewska</span>
				<p>Anna Wróblewska is assistant professor at Warsaw University of Technology. She has years of
					experience in the
					design of intelligent systems and description of semantic data acquired in a commercial and
					scientific
					environment. She is also a senior data scientist at Applica.ai, in charge of several R&D projects
					about
					text-mining, image recognition, and model diagnostics and interpretability. </p>
				<p>Previously she worked at Allegro, the biggest e-commerce marketplace portal in Eastern Europe, where
					she
					dealt with the intelligent methods of data analysis. She is the author of over 35 publications in
					Polish and
					international journals and materials. Her main research interests are focused on machine learning in
					practical
					applications, primarily the semantic understanding and modeling data and their interpretability.</p>

				<span class="name">Maria Knorps</span>
				<p>IPhD in Fluid Mechanics. For the last 10 years I have been working on mathematical modelling of
					particles in
					turbulent flows and numerical simulations on HPC. My professional goal is application of
					mathematical concepts
					such as stochastic calculus to real-life problems. I believe that visualization is a key to present
					highly
					abstract concepts and, in opposition to Fortran and Python which I have been writing in the longest,
					I have a
					growing interest in functional programming. Currently I use my experience in the world of Data
					Science in IF
					Research Poland. Privately I am mum of two extraordinary boys.</p>
